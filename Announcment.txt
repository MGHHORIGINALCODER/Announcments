The fog has closed in and it's coming into spawn. Ballers managed to make low gravity possible. I heard that they might be closing forest for a bit and fixing the lag. I also heard about changing the generators to a plasmid one. The Facility has gotten darker and harder to see as the generator is not powering the ventilation. There plans to replace them is to be confirmed October 31. We heard that there building a science lab down there too
